Colorado Election Results


 ---

## Overview of Project:

We have been requested by Tom and Seth who are Colorado Board of Elections employees who require our help to analyze and complete an audit of a local election that occurred recently. The following is a general step by step guide as to what we are doing:

 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.

2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.

3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.

4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Summary:

 

The dataset was provided by Tom and Seth who had everything recorded. We then used that data set to create a code that would provide us with the required outputs listed above under the overview section.

 

### Analysis:

 

We computed the following results from the data:

It is very clear to see that there were 369,711 votes cast in the local election. The results that were derived from this will be summarized below.

 

### Results:

---
Q1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

It is very clear to see that there were 369,711 votes cast in the local election. The results that were derived from this will be summarized below.

Q2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

County Votes:

Jefferson: 21.0% (77,709)

Denver: 165.6% (612,109)

Arapahoe: 13.4% (49,601)

Denver's opinion outweighs both Arapahoe, Colorado and Jefferson, Colorado combined!

Q3. Which county had the largest number of votes? 

Using our analysis we are able to that Denver county by far had the largest turnout amongst the three counties.  There could be a list of possible factors for this voter turnout, such as age group, population size, etc.  For example, we can possibly Denver, Colorado likely has a larger population residing in its county when in comparison to Jefferson, Colorado, and Araphaoe, Colorado.

Q4. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Out of the three potential candidates 1. Charles Casper Stockham, 2. Diana Degette, 3. Raymon Anthony Doan

Charles Casper Stocham = 85 213 / 369 711 = 23.0% of the votes

 

Diana Degette = 272 892  / 369 711 = 73.8% of the votes

 

Raymon Anthony Doane = 11 606 / 369 711 = 3.1% of the votes

---

Q5. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

There is quite a large margin between the first place candidate and the second place candidate. Diana Degette won by 50.8% more votes than the runner-up Charles Casper Stocham. There is a clear majority of votes for Diana and her policies must closely align with the majority of the population in those specific areas.
